## Description
This repository contains data supporting the manuscript examining taxonomic and functional diversity recovery trajectories in a Mixed Araucaria Forest chronosequence spanning over 40 years in southern Brazil.

## Study Area
Protected Mixed Araucaria Forest remnant in Lages municipality, southern Brazilian highlands (27°48'58"S, 50°19'30"W, 900-950 m elevation), Santa Catarina, Brazil. The region experiences humid subtropical climate with well-distributed rainfall and frequent winter frost events.

## Data File

**data.csv** - Individual tree measurements from 32 plots across different successional ages (924 individuals, 923 trees).

### Variables:
- `Plot` - Plot identifier (1-32)
- `Species` - Tree species scientific name
- `DBH(cm)` - Diameter at breast height in centimeters
- `Height(m)` - Tree height in meters
- `AgeClass` - Successional stage classification
  - `Inicial` - Early succession (13-21 years)
  - `Tardio` - Late succession (40 years)
- `Age` - Stand age in years since disturbance (13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 40)

### Sampling design:
- Early succession: 378 individuals from stands aged 13-21 years
- Late succession: 546 individuals from 40-year-old stands
- All trees ≥ 3 cm DBH
